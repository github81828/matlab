1. Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.
2. Write a  Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one.

Sample Dictionary :
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

1. Write a Python program to create an intersection of sets.

2. Write a Python program to create a union of sets.

3. Write a Python program to create set difference.

4. Write a Python program to create a symmetric difference.

5. Write a  Python program to check if a set is a subset of another set.

6. Write a  Python program to create a shallow copy of sets.

Note : Shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object.

🔥🔥🔥🔥

Exercise 1: Create a list by picking an odd-index items from the first list and even index items from the second
l1 = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
l2 = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]
expected:Element at odd-index positions from list one
[6, 12, 18]
Element at even-index positions from list two
[4, 12, 20, 28]
Printing Final third list
[6, 12, 18, 4, 12, 20, 28]

Exercise 2: Remove and add item in a list
Write a program to remove the item present at index 4 and add it to the 2nd position and at the end of the list.
Given:
list1 = [54, 44, 27, 79, 91, 41]
Expected Output:
List After removing element at index 4  [34, 54, 67, 89, 43, 94]
List after Adding element at index 2  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94]
List after Adding element at last  [34, 54, 11, 67, 89, 43, 94, 11]

Exercise 3: Slice list into 3 equal chunks and reverse each chunk
sample_list = [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]
Expected Outcome:
Chunk  1 [11, 45, 8]
After reversing it  [8, 45, 11]
Chunk  2 [23, 14, 12]
After reversing it  [12, 14, 23]
Chunk  3 [78, 45, 89]
After reversing it  [89, 45, 78]

Exercise 5: Create a Python set such that it shows the element from both lists in a pair
Given:
first_list = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
second_list = [4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]

Exercise 6: Find the intersection (common) of two sets and remove those elements from the first set
Given:
first_set = {23, 42, 65, 57, 78, 83, 29}
second_set = {57, 83, 29, 67, 73, 43, 48}
Expected Output:
Intersection is  {57, 83, 29}
First Set after removing common element  {65, 42, 78, 23}

Exercise 7: Checks if one set is a subset or superset of another set. If found, delete all elements from that set
Given:
first_set = {27, 43, 34}
second_set = {34, 93, 22, 27, 43, 53, 48}
Expected:First set is subset of second set - True
Second set is subset of First set -  False
First set is Super set of second set -  False
Second set is Super set of First set -  True
First Set  set()
Second Set  {67, 73, 43, 48, 83, 57, 29}

Exercise 8: Remove duplicates from a list and create a tuple and find the minimum and maximum number♦️
Given:
sample_list = [87, 45, 41, 65, 94, 41, 99, 94]
Expected:unique items [87, 45, 41, 65, 99]
tuple (87, 45, 41, 65, 99)
min: 41
max: 99
